# Laya – Audio & Text Alignment Tool

Laya is a lightweight browser-based tool built to align audio with word-level text for Sanskrit shlokas and other structured text, such as epics like the Ramayana. It supports manual timestamping, flagging, and transcript export — useful for training Text-to-Speech (TTS) models and precise sloka playback experiences (e.g., for Swara TTS).
